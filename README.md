Project Title
Rockfall Development

Short Description
Rockfall is a 3D space-shooter game built in Unity where players control a spacecraft defending a space station from incoming asteroids. The ship flies forward automatically through space while the player steers it using on-screen joystick controls.Your mission is to destroy asteroids before they collide with the station. Each hit reduces the station’s health until it is destroyed, ending the game.Rockfall focuses on fast-paced arcade action with simplified, “fake-physics” flight mechanics — smooth movement and quick reactions rather than complex space simulation. It’s designed to demonstrate 3D gameplay, UI integration, and object management in Unity.
